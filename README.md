### Featured Projects

#### Model Predictive Control for Autonomous Rocket Landing
- Linear, robust, and nonlinear MPC for a thrust-controlled rocket landing problem  
- System linearization, constraint tightening, offset-free tracking, and disturbance rejection  
- Validation through nonlinear simulations and performance analysis  
🔗 Repository: https://github.com/jvillaret/mpc-rocket-landing.git

#### Autonomous Mobile Robot Navigation & Localization
- Collaborative EPFL robotics project  
- Implemented the **global path planning module** from scratch  

**My contributions (path planning):**
- Designed and implemented a **visibility-graph–based global planner**
- Implemented polygon inflation for robot clearance handling
- Developed custom geometric routines:
  - segment–segment intersection
  - segment–polygon collision checking
  - point-in-polygon tests (ray casting)
- Built a shortest-path solver using **Dijkstra’s algorithm**
- Integrated planner into the navigation pipeline and added visualization tools for debugging
